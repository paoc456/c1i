  <h1>Williamsburg</h1>
  <h3>Entry 04</h3>
  <p>
    A collection of eclectic typefaces seen during my day in the Brooklyn neighbourhood. <br>
    A bit about Williamsburg â€“ the area was officially annexed as a Brookyln neighbourhood in 1855, previously known as
    Bushwick Shore. <br>
    Williamsburg used to have an 'h' (Williamsburgh), named by developer Jonathan Williams in 1802. <br>

      <img src="images/13.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
      <p style="width: 400px;">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">97 Montrose Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11206</span>

        <br>
        Robert E. Smith's Brush Script spotted within restaurant signage. One of my less favoured fonts but appears
        often for eateries and 'retro' logo designs,
        at least it's a nice shade of cornflower blue. Its slight tilt caught my attention, appearing handwritten and
        personalised.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="box2">
      <img src="images/15.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
      <p style="width: 400px;">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">163 Montrose Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11206</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        An enticing use of small cap letters. The thick, blocky, three-dimensional type in beige and bright pink paired
        not so well with the script font (or so I thought),
        but had a unique flair that suited the logo illustration.
      </p>

    <div class="box3">
      <img src="images/16.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
      <p style="width: 400px;">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Unknown address, Brooklyn</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        Not formally considered a typeface, but something that always catches my eye in New York. I did indeed stop and
        look.
        There is a certain emphemerality to this type of writing (or vandalism), disappearing when construction is
        complete.
      </p>

    <div class="box4">
      <img src="images/17.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
      <p style="width: 400px;">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">254 S 2nd St, Brooklyn, NY 11211</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        I previously only focused on their pizza, but going back this time, it really forced my eye to see their signage
        and branding.
        A satisfying brush script type with a slant that compliments each individual letter. The wordspacing was
        distinct, not a detail I've often see with script fonts.
