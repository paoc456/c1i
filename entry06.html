        <h1>East Village</h1>
        <h3>Entry 06</h3>
    </div>
    <p>
        A collection of signage seen during my stroll in the East Village. <br>
        The East Village is nested between East 4th and East 14th Street, Bowery and Avenue A. <br>
        The area is known to be artsy, home to many eateries, night life, and boutique stores. <br>
        The area was home to a large community of
        Ukrainian, Jewish, and Puerto Rican immigrants.

        <div class="box1">
            <img src="images/24.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
            <p style="width: 400px;">
                <span style="font-style: italic;">35 Cooper Sq, New York, NY 10003</span> <br> <br>
                A font that I instantly recognised as soon as I walked past - Misto, a funky all-caps typeface with
                unique glyphs and a blend of thick and thin lines. I particularly liked the way the dot extended past
                the cap height of all letters.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box2">
            <img src="images/25.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
            <p style="width: 400px;">
                <span style="font-style: italic;">207 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10003</span> <br> <br>
                What caught my eye initially was the text warp within the logo. Then, I noticed the notch on the 'J' and
                'A', adding visual interest to the logo. I found the slight curve/tail of these letter forms to be most
                intriguing.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box3">
            <img src="images/26.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
            <p style="width: 400px;">
                <span style="font-style: italic;">223 E 5th St, New York, NY 10003</span> <br> <br>
                A popular cafe spot I had heard of but never visited â€“ their logo featured a typeface that reminded me
                of the Dune franchise. A minimalistic, futuristic yet elegant logo executed with just three letters.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box4">
            <img src="images/27.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
            <p style="width: 400px;">
                <span style="font-style: italic;">157 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10003</span> <br> <br>
                A groovy, all-lowercase typeface and logo for a Japanese handroll bar. Although not my preferred colour
                palette, I admired the way the stems and bowls of the 'a' and 'k' curved, the change in stroke weight
                feels satisfying to the eye.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box5">
            <img src="images/28.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
            <p style="width: 400px;">
                <span style="font-style: italic;">181-189 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10003</span> <br> <br>
                The marquee outside of a movie theatre is a form of graphic design that I never really paid attention
                to. The typography is always interchangable and exists three dimensionally in its sans-serif form.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box6">
            <img src="images/29.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
            <p style="width: 400px;">
                <span style="font-style: italic;">25 Cooper Sq, New York, NY 10003</span> <br> <br>
                One of my favourite discoveries thus far. This was a sign on a gate outside a hotel, with the greenery
                surrounding it making its design all the more beautiful. I loved the negative spaces created within the
                letters and warping of the letters.
