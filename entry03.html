    <h3>Entry 03</h3>
    <p>
        A series of boutique stores logos, restaurant plaques, and print design typography. <br>
        This week features bolder yet polished examples of type, intentionally altering glyphs with embellishments.

        1 Clinton St, New York, NY 10002 <br>
        Big, bold and chunky typeface with decreased tracking between letters for a condensed feel. I particularly noticed and liked the letter 'G' of the logo, <br>
        the letter wraps into itself to maintain a consistent width with all characters.

        100 Stanton St, New York, NY 10002 <br>
        The Frankie Shop, a boutique store with a minimalistic logo and store design. Stems of T and F interesect with stroke of the S for a sleek, timeless aesthetic. <br>
        Another touch I liked was that the F nests into the bar of the T.

        130 Orchard St, New York, NY 10002 <br>
        Perrotin design store, featured a series of artist and design books. I was drawn to the covers with only typography, forcing the viewers' eye to focus on the title and how it interacts with the background. <br>
        I was most compelled by the gothic-serif type, and the cover with a wrap-around all caps san serif. Both have strong juxtapositions of positive and negative space.

        250 Lafayette St, New York, NY 10012 <br>
        After going into LES, I wandered into the NoHo/SoHo area and discovered an array of unique type design. <br>
        New York or Nowhere is a label I had heard of before but never visited its store. The distinct 'N', 'K' and 'H' glyphs of the logo make the brand extremely memorable to me. <br>
        The tracking and kerning of the logo design creates one phrase instead of separate words â€“ a clever, intentional design choice.

        70 A Spring St, New York, NY 10012 <br>
        Sundays Nail Salon, a beautifully unexpected logo I came across when I was leaving the area. The blend of 'u' and 'n' in this one caught my attention, creating an air of luxury. <br>
        This technique of type manipulation would surely be something I will take inspiration from.
