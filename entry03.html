  <h3>Entry 03</h3>
  <p>
    A series of boutique stores logos, restaurant plaques, and print design typography. <br>
    This week features bolder yet polished examples of type, intentionally altering glyphs with embellishments. <br>

        <br>
        Big, bold and chunky typeface with decreased tracking between letters for a condensed feel. I particularly
        noticed and liked the letter 'G' of the logo, <br>
        the letter wraps into itself to maintain a consistent width with all characters.

        The Frankie Shop, a boutique store with a minimalistic logo and store design. Stems of T and F interesect with
        stroke of the S for a sleek, timeless aesthetic.
        Another touch I liked was that the F nests into the bar of the T.

        <br>
        Perrotin design store, featured a series of artist and design books. I was drawn to the covers with only
        typography, forcing the viewers' eye to focus on the title and how it interacts with the background.
        I was most compelled by the gothic-serif type, and the cover with a wrap-around all caps san serif. Both have
        strong juxtapositions of positive and negative space.

    <div class="box4">
      <img src="images/11.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
      <p style="width: 400px;">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">250 Lafayette St, New York, NY 10012</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        After going into LES, I wandered into the NoHo/SoHo area and discovered an array of unique type design.
        New York or Nowhere is a label I had heard of before but never visited its store. The distinct 'N', 'K' and 'H'
        glyphs of the logo make the brand extremely memorable to me.
        The tracking and kerning of the logo design creates one phrase instead of separate words â€“ a clever, intentional
        design choice.

    <div class="box5">
      <img src="images/12.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
      <p style="width: 400px;">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">70 A Spring St, New York, NY 10012</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        Sundays Nail Salon, a beautifully unexpected logo I came across when I was leaving the area. The blend of 'u'
        and 'n' in this one caught my attention, creating an air of luxury.
        This technique of type manipulation would surely be something I will take inspiration from.
