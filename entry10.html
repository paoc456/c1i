        Flushing is a neighbourhood in the Northern part of Queens. Historically, it was occupied by the Matinecock <br>
        Indian tribe, a division of the Algonquin Nation. It is now home to a large immigrant population, with one of
        <br>
        the largest Chinatowns outside of Asia.

            <img src="images/48.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
            <p style="width: 400px;">
                <span style="font-style: italic;">38-1 Prince St, Flushing, NY 11354</span> <br> <br>
                I was greeted by this map and signage near a bakery I had visited. This was one of the first instances
                where I had found vertically typeset lettters and all capitals. I particularly liked the natural drop
                shadow that formed due to the raised surface.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box2">
            <img src="images/49.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
            <p style="width: 400px;">
                <span style="font-style: italic;">135-15 37th Ave, Flushing, NY 11354</span> <br> <br>
                This was an interesting banner logo, as the light strip signs and Chinese characters overlap with the
                pink, sans-serif type (what I assume to be Helvetica). However, I liked this interplay of a rounded
                Chinese script with a flatter latin font.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box3">
            <img src="images/50.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
            <p style="width: 400px;">
                <span style="font-style: italic;">135-32 37th Ave, Flushing, NY 11354</span> <br> <br>
                I felt that this was an intriguing mix of Comic Sans and a handwritten typeface, with over exaggerated
                round strokes but not quite wobbly enough to be Comic Sans. The 'a' in particular is very circular with
                a slight tail.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box4">
            <img src="images/51.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
            <p style="width: 400px;">
                <span style="font-style: italic;">37-18 Main St, Flushing, NY 11354</span> <br> <br>
                By far one of the most free-handed typefaces I've seen, the individual characters are all uniquely
                different in size and shape, with varied heavy and light strokes. I thought the tail stroke on the 'R'
                extending was a clever choice.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box5">
            <img src="images/52.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
            <p style="width: 400px;">
                <span style="font-style: italic;">4144 Kissena Blvd, Flushing, NY 11355</span> <br> <br>
                This signage was interesting in that the logic and style for both the latin and Chinese characters
                translated across one another with conjoined strokes and squared-off bowls despite being very rounded
                overall.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box6">
            <img src="images/53.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
            <p style="width: 400px;">
                <span style="font-style: italic;">41-28 Main St, Flushing, NY 11354</span> <br> <br>
                Common with a lot of the other restaurant and store logos I saw in Flushing, this logo replaces a letter
                with a graphic illustration. It has a mix of rounded and straight strokes, with generally condensed
                letterforms.
