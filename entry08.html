    <p>
        A series of signage observed throughout the city of Beacon, primarily on its Main Street. <br>
        It is 60 miles North of New York City and was one of the first communities of the state. <br> It was known as
        the 'Hat Making Capital' of the United States, functioning as a factory town <br> until 1970 when it saw an
        economic
        decline.

    <div class="entry07img">
        <div class="box1">
            <img src="images/36.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
            <p style="width: 400px;">
                <span style="font-style: italic;">297 Main St, Beacon, NY 12508</span> <br> <br>
                A curved, symmetrical typeface design specifically for the restaurant Enoteca Ama. The rounded stroke on
                the letter 'A' was the most intriguing to me, the letter forms felt reminiscent of art deco styles but
                still suited its cuisine.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box2">
            <img src="images/37.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
            <p style="width: 400px;">
                <span style="font-style: italic;">285 Main St, Beacon, NY 12508</span> <br> <br>
                An interesting mix of condensed typefaces in a retro, painted signage style. The use of all capital
                letters drew my attention in a typeface I most associate with American media, and one of the first
                instances of fonts using drop shadows.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box3">
            <img src="images/38.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
            <p style="width: 400px;">
                <span style="font-style: italic;">209 Main St, Beacon, NY 125085</span> <br> <br>
                Unlike other typefaces I've seen thus far, this was on the ground and made of tile rather than one solid
                unit. It was the entrance to a hair salon, with hexagonal tiles forming these distinct numbers greeting
                you at the door.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box4">
            <img src="images/39.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
            <p style="width: 400px;">
                <span style="font-style: italic;">199 Main St, Beacon, NY 12508</span> <br> <br>
                One of my favourite typefaces of all time, Futura, spotted on packaging design inside of a home goods
                store. Its distinct, sharp letterforms are immediately recognisable and is used effectively in
                conjunction with the duotoned palette.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box5">
            <img src="images/40.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
            <p style="width: 400px;">
                <span style="font-style: italic;">188 Main St, Beacon, NY 12508</span> <br> <br>
                Nestled within a collection of old books within an antique store, was a book cover with embellished
                serif letters. I particularly appreciated the art nouveau styled design and slanted serifs of the title,
                a dynamic design that I don't see often.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box6">
            <img src="images/41.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
            <p style="width: 400px;">
                <span style="font-style: italic;">Main St, Beacon, NY 12508</span> <br> <br>
                What I believe to be Helvetica, was displayed on the main sign at the entrance. The hierarchy of the
                signage was executed well and I liked the mix of capital letters with lowercase, particularly in this
                bolder font weight.
