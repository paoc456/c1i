        Tyepfaces seen throughout the neighbourhood of Fort Greene in Brooklyn. <br>
        Fort Greene was named after the Fort Greene Park, which was a critical landmark during <br>
        the American
        Revolution, with the name taking after Nathanael Greene, a war general. <br>
        The district is full of brownstone buildings, nature and many community activities. <br>

            <p style="width: 400px;">
                <span style="font-style: italic;">757 Fulton St, Brooklyn, NY 11217</span> <br> <br>
                As soon as I came out from the subway exit, I was greeted with a lime green restaurant banner. From what
                I could tell about the quaint eatery, this looked to be a hand-painted sign reminiscent of retro-styled
                brush script.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box2">
            <img src="images/31.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
            <p style="width: 400px;">
                <span style="font-style: italic;">96 Lafayette Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11217</span> <br> <br>
                An aspect of type I don't often notice, which are numbers. This was a set of number tiles in a style I
                had never come across before, its porcelain quality and cobalt blue glaze made it stand out against the
                other brownstones next to it.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box3">
            <img src="images/32.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
            <p style="width: 400px;">
                <span style="font-style: italic;">323-321 Clermont Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11205</span> <br> <br>
                A random red truck I came across while walking to my next destination. This black style typeface on the
                back of the truck, with a three dimensional drop shadow embellishment was extremely eyecatching.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box4">
            <img src="images/33.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
            <p style="width: 400px;">
                <span style="font-style: italic;">279 Lafayette Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11238</span> <br> <br>
                Back on Lafayette Avenue, I spotted a gothic style typeface on the front of a church entrance. These
                individual letters are the rounded, uncial styled characters that date back to historical developments
                of typography.
            </p>

        <div class="box5">
            <img src="images/34.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
            <p style="width: 400px;">
                <span style="font-style: italic;">448 Lafayette Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11205</span> <br> <br>
                A distinct, blocky typeface to compliment a donut shop brand identity. What caught my eye the most was
                the outline
                version of the typeface, how the strokes of the 'K' in particular are separate shapes.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box6">
            <img src="images/35.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
            <p style="width: 400px;">
                <span style="font-style: italic;">471 Dekalb Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11205</span> <br> <br>
                A picturesque eatery sign that I noticed near the Pratt campus. The serif typeface was quite delicate
                and elegant, and I thought it was visually interesting how its letterspacing is played with due to the
                panels of the glass/wood.
