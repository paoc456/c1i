    <h1>Financial District</h1>
    <h3>Entry 05</h3>
    <p>
        Interesting typefaces while passing through FiDi (of things other than restaurant banners). <br>
        Some background on the Financial District – this is the historic center of finance and commerce in New York
        City. <br> The New York Stock Exchange opened in 1792 and was where many of New York City's largest banks were
        first
        established. <br> FiDi is home to some of the world's largest banks and investment firms.

            <img src="images/18.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
            <p style="width: 400px;">
                <span style="font-style: italic;">121 Fulton St, New York, NY 10038</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                A restaurant and bar with signage that features small cap letters. The choice of using lights within the
                sign makes the type appear as an outline font. There is an interesting juxtaposition between the thick,
                straight stems and the curved lines of the 'e' and 'n' – uncial letters with characteristic strokes like
                this.
            </p>

        <div class="box2">
            <img src="images/19.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
            <p style="width: 400px;">
                <span style="font-style: italic;">Nassau St, New York, NY 10038</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                A corner boutique shop with a minimalistic signature as a logo. I really liked the choice to intersect
                and overlap the stem with the bowl. This typeface reminds me of 'Copperplate' (perhaps it may be?)
            </p>

        <div class="box3">
            <img src="images/20.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
            <p style="width: 400px;">
                <span style="font-style: italic;">222 Broadway, New York, NY 10038</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                I haven't taken as much time to notice numbers as of late, but this big set of 2's caught my eye while I
                was walking to the subway. Despite being uniform in size, the slats of the wall distort its form and
                gives them a sense of movement.
            </p>

        <div class="box4">
            <img src="images/21.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
            <p style="width: 400px;">
                <span style="font-style: italic;">200 Broadway, New York, NY 10007</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                I reach the Fulton Center station entrance and am greeted with the iconic Helvetica type signage, a
                consistent element throughout MTA and something I've grown to appreciate during my time in New York.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box5">
            <img src="images/22.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
            <p style="width: 400px;">
                <span style="font-style: italic;">200 Broadway, New York, NY 10007</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                One of the largest interchange stations I have been to, with connections to twelve different trains.
                Something about the uniform and aligned Helvetica letters/numbers on the pole was extremely satisfying.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box6">
            <img src="images/23.JPG" alt="1" width="400" />
            <p style="width: 400px;">
                <span style="font-style: italic;">200 Broadway, New York, NY 10007</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                Now on the subway platform, I noticed this unique 'F' glyph on every column that lined the walls of the
                station. The serifs are exaggerated and feels rustic, somewhat gothic – a contrast to the classic
                Helvectica.
